Overview of the Project

Project: BMI Claculator

Objective

The objective of the project is to build web app on to-do list. To provide users with a simple and accurate tool for assessing their body weight relative to their height, enabling them to determine their BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) and promoting awareness of potential health risks associated with their body composition.

Technolgies used:

• HTML: A to-do list web app built using HTML provides a simple, structured framework for creating and managing tasks. HTML defines the app's core elements, such as task input fields, lists, buttons, and form structures.
• CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a powerful design language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages.
• Javascript: JavaScript’s dynamic capabilities to offer features like drag-and-drop task reordering, customizable lists, and smart reminders
